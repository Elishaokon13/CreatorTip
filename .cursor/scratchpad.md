# Background and Motivation
We need to scaffold **CreatorTip**, a Web3 tipping micro-app on Lens Protocol targeting deployment on Polygon. The app lets users tip Lens creators in MATIC or BONSAI via Lens Open Actions and rewards tippers with a Supporter NFT.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Monorepo scaffolding for frontend, backend, and smart contracts
- Integrating Lens Protocol SDKs securely on client and server
- Smart contract design: token transfers + NFT minting + access control
- Efficient off-chain data flows using Momoka to minimize gas
- Wallet connection and Lens authentication flows
- Environment variable management for RPC, IPFS, API keys, private keys
- Keeping UI minimal and functionality-focused

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. Initialize monorepo structure with Next.js frontend, Express backend, and Hardhat contracts
2. Scaffold frontend: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, wagmi & RainbowKit
3. Implement landing page (wallet connect + Sign in with Lens)
4. Implement tip page scaffold with amount input and Tip button
5. Implement dashboard page scaffold (display total tips + NFT holders)
6. Scaffold backend: Express server with Open Action and analytics endpoints
7. Integrate @lens-protocol/node SDK in server routes
8. Configure contracts: Hardhat setup and contracts folder
9. Create `CreatorTip.sol` with `tip` and `mintSupporterNFT` functions
10. Write Hardhat deploy script for Polygon Mumbai
11. Setup environment variables placeholders (`.env.local`)
12. Create `README.md` with setup instructions and sample workflow

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- `frontend/pages/index.tsx` updated with wallet connect and Sign in with Lens using RainbowKit and Lens SDK.
- `frontend/pages/tip/[postId].tsx` scaffolded for tipping UI with amount, token selector, and Open Action API call.
- Updated error handling in `frontend/pages/tip/[postId].tsx` to use `unknown` and type-safe checks instead of `any`.
- Next subtask: Implement dashboard page scaffold at `frontend/pages/dashboard.tsx`.

# Lessons
- Always verify peer dependency requirements of SDKs against the framework's React version.
- Avoid pre-creating placeholder files that conflict with scaffolding tools.
- Verify npm package names before installing; the correct Lens Node SDK package is `@lens-protocol/client` rather than `@lens-protocol/node`.
- Hardhat CLI interactive mode may not work in scripted environments; manual config creation can be more reliable.
