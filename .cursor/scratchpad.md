# Background and Motivation
We need to scaffold **CreatorTip**, a Web3 tipping micro-app on Lens Protocol targeting deployment on Polygon. The app lets users tip Lens creators in MATIC or BONSAI via Lens Open Actions and rewards tippers with a Supporter NFT.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Monorepo scaffolding for frontend, backend, and smart contracts
- Integrating Lens Protocol SDKs securely on client and server
- Smart contract design: token transfers + NFT minting + access control
- Efficient off-chain data flows using Momoka to minimize gas
- Wallet connection and Lens authentication flows
- Environment variable management for RPC, IPFS, API keys, private keys
- Keeping UI minimal and functionality-focused

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. Initialize monorepo structure with Next.js frontend, Express backend, and Hardhat contracts
2. Scaffold frontend: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, wagmi & RainbowKit
3. Implement landing page (wallet connect + Sign in with Lens)
4. Implement tip page scaffold with amount input and Tip button
5. Implement dashboard page scaffold (display total tips + NFT holders)
6. Scaffold backend: Express server with Open Action and analytics endpoints
7. Integrate @lens-protocol/client SDK in server routes
8. Configure contracts: Hardhat setup and contracts folder
9. Create `CreatorTip.sol` with `tip` and `mintSupporterNFT` functions
10. Write Hardhat deploy script for Polygon Mumbai and Lens Testnet, Base Goerli
11. Setup environment variables placeholders (`.env.local`)
12. Create `README.md` with setup instructions and sample workflow
13. **Enable multichain support**: add Base Goerli, Polygon Mumbai, Lens Testnet, plus mainnet networks
14. **Implement chain selector UI** in frontend for users to choose network
15. **Refactor Wagmi config** to dynamically support selected chain

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Attempted to deploy to Base Goerli testnet via `npm run deploy:base`, but received HardhatError HH110: Invalid JSON-RPC response (error code: 1016).
  - This indicates the RPC endpoint may be incorrect/unreachable or the account lacks funds.
  - Please verify that `BASE_RPC_URL` in `.env.local` is correctly set to a working Base Goerli RPC (e.g., `https://goerli.base.org` or another provider) and that the deployer account has test ETH on Base Goerli.
- **Next subtask:** Retry deployment after confirming RPC URL and funding.
- Completed subtask: Retried deployment and successfully deployed `CreatorTip` to Base Goerli at 0xf94cD9418B837aE77e4BFCAA0439D0C777f15c24.
- **Next subtask:** Update `CREATOR_TIP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env.local` with the deployed address and integrate it into the frontend/backend.
- Completed subtask: Reviewed `scripts/deploy.ts`. It correctly loads environment variables from `.env.local`, parses `INITIAL_SUPPORTED_TOKENS`, and passes both `openActionAddress` and `initialTokens` to the constructor.
  - Suggestion: Consider adding validation for non-empty `openActionAddress` and logging the network chain ID prior to deployment.
- **Next subtask:** Integrate the `CREATOR_TIP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` into the backend analytics route and frontend configuration.
