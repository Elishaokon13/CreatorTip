# Background and Motivation
We need to scaffold **CreatorTip**, a Web3 tipping micro-app on Lens Protocol targeting deployment on Polygon. The app lets users tip Lens creators in MATIC or BONSAI via Lens Open Actions and rewards tippers with a Supporter NFT.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Monorepo scaffolding for frontend, backend, and smart contracts
- Integrating Lens Protocol SDKs securely on client and server
- Smart contract design: token transfers + NFT minting + access control
- Efficient off-chain data flows using Momoka to minimize gas
- Wallet connection and Lens authentication flows
- Environment variable management for RPC, IPFS, API keys, private keys
- Keeping UI minimal and functionality-focused

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. Initialize monorepo structure with Next.js frontend, Express backend, and Hardhat contracts
2. Scaffold frontend: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, wagmi & RainbowKit
3. Implement landing page (wallet connect + Sign in with Lens)
4. Implement tip page scaffold with amount input and Tip button
5. Implement dashboard page scaffold (display total tips + NFT holders)
6. Scaffold backend: Express server with Open Action and analytics endpoints
7. Integrate @lens-protocol/node SDK in server routes
8. Configure contracts: Hardhat setup and contracts folder
9. Create `CreatorTip.sol` with `tip` and `mintSupporterNFT` functions
10. Write Hardhat deploy script for Polygon Mumbai
11. Setup environment variables placeholders (`.env.local`)
12. Create `README.md` with setup instructions and sample workflow

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- `frontend/pages/index.tsx` updated with wallet connect and Sign in with Lens using RainbowKit and Lens SDK.
- `frontend/pages/tip/[postId].tsx` scaffolded for tipping UI with amount, token selector, and Open Action API call.
- Updated error handling in `frontend/pages/tip/[postId].tsx` to use `unknown` and type-safe checks instead of `any`.
- `frontend/pages/dashboard.tsx` scaffolded to fetch and display total tips, top tippers, and supporters.
- Express server initialized in `server/index.js` with CORS, JSON parsing, and route mounting.
- Stub routes added in `server/routes/open-action.js` and `server/routes/tips.js`.
- Open Action route in `server/routes/open-action.js` now calls `lensClient.openActions.tip` and returns real `txHash`.
- Tips analytics route in `server/routes/tips.js` returns placeholder analytics object.
- Analytics route now reads on-chain events from the `CreatorTip` contract on Polygon Mumbai, computing total tips, top tippers, and supporters.
- Ensure `CREATOR_TIP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `POLYGON_RPC_URL` are set in `.env.local`.
- **Next subtask:** Verify Hardhat deployment script and test end-to-end flow locally.
- To verify and run the Hardhat deployment, please ensure `.env.local` has valid `POLYGON_RPC_URL` and `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` values set.
- **Request:** Confirm that environment variables are configured so I can run `npm run deploy` in `contracts/` to test deployment.
- Added `lensTestnetChain` config in `frontend/pages/_app.tsx` for Lens Chain Testnet (ID 37111).
- Updated `.env.example` and tips route to use `LENS_RPC_URL` for Lens Testnet.
- **Note:** Update `LENS_RPC_URL` in `.env.local` to `https://rpc.testnet.lens.xyz` before redeploying and testing.
- Attempted deployment to `lensTestnet`, but encountered `insufficient funds` error for gas.
- Wallet balance is 0; please fund the deployment key with testnet GRASS from the Lens Chain Testnet faucet.
- **Request:** Let me know once the wallet is funded so I can redeploy and complete end-to-end tests.

# Lessons
- Always verify peer dependency requirements of SDKs against the framework's React version.
- Avoid pre-creating placeholder files that conflict with scaffolding tools.
- Verify npm package names before installing; the correct Lens Node SDK package is `@lens-protocol/client` rather than `@lens-protocol/node`.
- Hardhat CLI interactive mode may not work in scripted environments; manual config creation can be more reliable.
